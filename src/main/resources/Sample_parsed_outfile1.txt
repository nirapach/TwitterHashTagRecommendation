1701%***%Brunch at Yolk was tasty, and even though I'm generally not a fan of superhero movies, Captain America was pretty damn awesome.%***%

1776%***%I'm not sure about anything  specific, but the base terminal provided with OS X doesn't support color - period.%***%
1777%***%I don't think so. Few things can't be automated - and I'm not thinking spam detection and suspension is one of them.%***%
